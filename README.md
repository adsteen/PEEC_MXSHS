# Data and Code for Mullen et al (2018)

This repostitory contains all data and code to recreate the plots and other findings from [Mullen et al (2018) Potential activities of freshwater exo- and endo-acting extracellular peptidases in East Tennessee and the Pocono mountains, Frontiers in Microbiology, doi: 10.3389/fmicb.2018.00368](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2018.00368/abstract).

The script was run using R version 3.4.1 and the following packages:

* **plyr** v 1.8.4
* **reshape2** v 1.4.2
* **ggplot2** v 2.2.1
* **lubridate** v 1.7.1
* **gridExtra** v 2.3

The script assumes that the working directory contains directories structured as in this repo. Since git would prefer users not add empty directories, the user will have to add a plots directory or change the path that plots are saved to.

Please direct questions or comments about this code to [Andrew Steen](mailto:asteen1@utk.edu).
